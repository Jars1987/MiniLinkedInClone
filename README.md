# Mini LinkedIn Clone

Mini clone of LinkedIn. One page Web with posts and authentication. Mini clone
of LinkedIn. In sumary is a one page Web with posts and authentication. Watched
Sonny Sangha turtorial for Linkedin Clone on youtube but made my own changes.

1. Used the recent Firebase vs9 instead of the vs8 used by Sony. It changed a
   bit but the documentation is quite clear. Also prefered to use async await
   instead of .then to chain promises
2. I also used the Redux for both Posts and User logic when Sony only used Redux
   for some of the user logic.
3. Also done some minor error handling just for fun.

Hopefully this is the first of many clones I am sending this way before my big
gaming app.

Stay tunned.
